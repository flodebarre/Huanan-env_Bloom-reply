R scripts to reproduce the results presented in a reply to [Bloom (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vead050).

-  The correlation values in the main text and recapitulated in Table S1 are generated by running `scripts/outoutput_correlations.R`. This creates a `.tex` file in the `paper/` folder with commands containing the values. 

-  [Table S2](https://github.com/flodebarre/Huanan-env_Bloom-reply/blob/main/results/prop-chordates_human.csv) is generated by running `scripts/compute_proportions_chordates`. 

-  Figures are generated with `scripts/plot_correlations.R`. There are more figures in the `figs/` folder than in the article; they helped explore the results and are kept for legacy. The plotted correlations were computed in `scripts/compute_correlations.R` and the corresponding outputs are saved in `results/`.
