R scripts to reproduce the results presented in a reply to [Bloom (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vead050).

-  The correlation values in the main text are generated by running `scripts/outoutput_correlations.R`. This creates a `.tex` file in the `paper/` folder with commands containing the values. 

-  [Table S1](https://github.com/flodebarre/Huanan-env_Bloom-reply/blob/main/results/prop-chordates_human.csv) is generated by running `scripts/compute_proportions_chordates`. 

-  The scripts `compute_correlations.R` and `plot_correlations.R` are not used in the final version of the article, but helped explore the results, so they are kept for legacy. Outputs are saved in `results/` and `figs/`.
